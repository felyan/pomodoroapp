# Pomodoro App
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that can be used for any task.
The aim of the Pomodoro Technique is to use time as a valuable ally in accomplishing what we want to do in the way we want to do it, and to enable us to improve continually the way we work or study.

## Motivation
The Pomodoro Technique will provide a simple tool/process for improving productivity (your own and that of your team members) which can do the following:
- Reduce anxiety linked to beginning
- Enhance focus and concentration by cutting down on interruptions
- Boost motivation and keep it constant
- Bolster the determination to achieve your goals
- Improve your work or study process

## Operation
Set your main task, and set the times in Let's Focus.
You can set a work time, a short-break time between the work sessions, and a long-break time.
Start working:
1. Start the Pomodoro timer
2. Work until the Pomodoro rings
3. Take a short break (10 minutes)
4. Keep on working, Pomodoro after Pomodoro, until the task at hand is finished. Every 3 Pomodoros take a longer break, (30 minutes).

In Settings you can costumize your pomodoro: you can set the background color and the text color.
